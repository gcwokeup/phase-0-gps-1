1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Before my GPS session I was struggling to remember the git workflow.  I found myself referencing my notes a lot because I was afraid of messing it up.  By the end of week two I am very confident with the git workflow process.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The git workflow process from start to finish was definitely clarified during my GPS.  I think that using it so many times in a row really helped solidify the process.  I also think that it helped having to navigate someone through the workflow.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

My pair was able to help when I forgot what the next step in the git workflow was, I think that when you are the driver sometimes you freeze up and it was nice having someone that was able to keep the challenge moving.  My guide was able to help me figure out how to see what branches I have open.  At the time of my GPS I had multiple terminals open because I was afraid to close out of one and not remember what I called a branch.

4. What still confuses you about git?

The thing that still confuses me is interpreting errors and figuring out solutions to different error messages.  Before writing this reflection I tried to update a couple of my submissions for other challenges and I encountered merge conflicts of some sort.  I still have not figured them out, but I am going to go back and try to get everything reconciled today.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I really enjoyed my first guided pairing experience.  My pair was a really great personality match for me he let me feel my way through the challenge and did not seem to get frustrated at all if I did not understand him correctly.  I thought that it was a really respectful, collaborative environment.  The guide really let us do our own thing for the most part.  He did not try to push us in one direction or another.  I also liked that he made us verbalize some of the different concepts to make sure that we understood them properly.
